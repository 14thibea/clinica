# `statistics-volume` - Statistics for volume

Perform 2-sample t-test on your NIfTI images generated by Clinica. 

## Dependencies
If you installed the docker image of Clinica, nothing is required. If you only installed the core of Clinica, this pipeline needs the installation of **SPM** on its standalone form or with **Matlab** on your computer. You can find how to install this software on the [installation](../#installing-clinica-from-source) page.


## Running the pipeline
The pipeline can be run with the following command line:

```
clinica run statistics-volume caps_directory subject_visits_with_covariates_tsv contrast feature_type group_id
```
where:

  - `caps_directory` is the output folder containing the results in a [CAPS](../CAPS) hierarchy.
  - `subject_visits_with_covariates_tsv` is the path to the TSV file with covariables (mandatory, unlike other Clinica pipelines)
  - `contrast` is the name of the contrast used to differntiate the 2 groups
  - `feature_type` indicates to Clinica what volume to use
  - `group_id` defines the group name for the anaysis


## Outputs

Results are stored in the following folder of the [CAPS hierarchy](docs/CAPS): `groups/group-<group_id>//<some_folder>`.

The main output files are:

  - `<source_file>_labelname-<label>_mainouput1`: description main output 1.

  - `<source_file>_labelname-<label>_mainouput2`: description main output 2.

The full list of output files can be found in the [ClinicA Processed Structure (CAPS) Specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mjXbqRceHK0fD0BIONniLK713zY7DbQHJEV7kxqsd8/edit#heading=h.f4ddnk971gkn).
