# Clinica Documentation

## [What is Clinica?](WhatIsClinica)

## Installation

Clinica can be installed on Mac OS X and Linux (CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu) machines, and possibly on Windows computers with a Linux Virtual Machine. We assume that users installing and using Clinica are comfortable with using the command line.

!!! info "Clinica on GitHub!"
    Clinica has moved to GitHub, you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinica/).

<!-- !!! info "New release: Clinica 0.2!"
    We are very pleased to announce the release 0.2 of Clinica. The release notes are available here: [v0.2.0](https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinica/releases/tag/v0.2.0), [v0.2.1](https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinica/releases/tag/v0.2.1). -->

<!-- ### Installing Clinica from source -->
  - [Installation](./Installation)
  - [Third-party software](./Third-party)  

<!-- ### Installing Clinica using Docker
Another way to install Clinica is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker). The installation procedure of the Clinica Docker image, which contains everything required to launch any pipeline of Clinica, is explained [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/aramis/clinica_docker).    -->

<!-- ### Using Clinica on the ICM cluster
ICM members are encouraged to use the version of Clinica available on the cluster. Installation instructions are available [here](./ICMClusterInstallation). -->

## Citing Clinica
For publications or communications using Clinica, please include the following text:

!!! quote "Citing Clinica"
    Analyses were performed using the Clinica software platform (www.clinica.run) developed by the ARAMIS Lab ([www.aramislab.fr](http://www.aramislab.fr/)).

Each pipeline's page includes text to cite the software packages that are used by Clinica. Use them depending on the specific pipelines that you used (for example, citing SPM when using the `t1-volume` pipeline).

!!! info "Disclaimer"
    Clinica is a software for research studies. It is not intended for use in medical routine
