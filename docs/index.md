# Clinica Documentation

## [What is Clinica?](WhatIsClinica)

## Installation

Clinica can be installed on Mac OS X and Linux (CentOS or Debian/Ubuntu) machines, and possibly on Windows computers with a Linux Virtual Machine. We assume that users installing and using Clinica are comfortable with using the command line.

<!-- !!! info "Clinica on GitHub!"
    Clinica has moved to GitHub, you can find the repo [here](https://github.com/aramis-lab/clinica/).-->

!!! info "New release: Clinica 0.3.2!"
    We are very pleased to announce the release 0.3.2 of Clinica. The release notes are available here: [v0.3.2](http://bit.ly/2tfZjvh).

<!-- ### Installing Clinica from source -->
  - [Installation](./Installation)
  - [Third-party software](./Third-party)  

<!-- ### Installing Clinica using Docker
Another way to install Clinica is to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker). The installation procedure of the Clinica Docker image, which contains everything required to launch any pipeline of Clinica, is explained [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/aramis/clinica_docker).    -->

<!-- ### Using Clinica on the ICM cluster
ICM members are encouraged to use the version of Clinica available on the cluster. Installation instructions are available [here](./ICMClusterInstallation). -->
